# NeoVim Configuration For Fullstack Java Developers

Welcome to the start, or continuation of your NeoVim journey, I'm excited to have you on board!

This repository holds the configuration code for my simple yet effective NeoVim configuration for Fullstack Java Developers who's primary job is to develop Spring Boot Applications and Frontends using TypeScript and React.

Of course this is just a starting point for you to configure, and just the tip of the ice berg when it comes to customization, so whenever you move onto different languages, or want more features I have designed the structure of the configuratuion to be easily customized.

This configuration repository goes along with my tutorial on how to setup NeoVim for Java Developers, which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/zbpF3te0M3g) to follow along and get explanations of the different plugins we are configuring.

## Plugins

I attempted to keep the plugins in this configuration to a minimum to reduce the bulk, but also to just build a strong foundation to build on top of. I did not want to include a ton of plugins that people might or might not immediately uninstall because they felt they didn't need them.

This configuration uses the ever popular Lazy.nvim to manage the plugins because of the simplicity, popularity, and the great documenation around it. The great thing about this starter and Lazy.nvim in general, is that once you have installed and configured just a few plugins, you will basically know how to install any new plugin you like once you start to add your own tastes.

Below I have listed all the plugins which are included in the configuration, and which I think are almost vital to a great development experience when it comes to Java and TypeScript:
